# Challenge

Set up React Router for our app. We should be able to do the following:

1. Click on the words "Pic Some" in the header to go to the "/" route, which should display the Photos component (found in the pages folder)

2. Click on the shopping cart icon in the header to go to the "/cart" route, which should display the Cart component (found in the pages folder)

# Context challenge

Set up the Context for our app.
1. In a new file, create a new context with React
2. In that same file, create a custom component that renders the Provider of the context you created
3. For now, just pass in an empty string "" as the context provider's value prop
4. Export the custom Provider component and the full context object (so we can pass it to the useContext hook eventually)
5. Set up your index.js to use the custom context Provider you created. (You can wrap it as a parent of the Router component)

# Challenge
Add state to our context and pass it through the Provider
1. Add state to hold the array of all photos our app gets from the API
2. Pass the array of all photos through the value of the provider so it's available anywhere the app accesses the context

# Challenge
Get the JSON data with the photos information from the API and save it to context state
1. As soon as the ContextProvider component renders, get the JSON data from this url:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bobziroll/scrimba-react-bootcamp-images/master/images.json
2. Save the array of data that comes back to state.

# Challenge
Using the data in context state, map over it in the Photos page and display the images.

# Challenge
On the Image component, track the hover state
1. Create state boolean for "hovered"
2. When the mouse enters the Image's div, set "hovered" to true
3. When the mouse leaves the Image's div, set "hovered" to false
4. Log "hovered" to the console so you know it's changing successfully.

# Challenge
Conditionally render the heart and plus icons when an Image component is being hovered on
1. Icon to render for the heart:
<!-- <i className="ri-heart-line favorite"></i> -->
2. Icon to render for the plus:
<!-- <i className="ri-add-circle-line cart"></i> -->

# Challenge
Add ability to toggle an image's `isFavorited` property by clicking the heart icon (filled heart doesn't need to display on the image yet)
1. Add a toggleFavorite method to context. It should take an `id` parameter and update the array of allPhotos by flipping the `isFavorited` property of the photo with the matching `id`
    a. Have this function also console.log something so we know it's running correctly
    b. Don't try to modify the individual image object only. Make sure to provide a whole new array to context with the one item with the matching `id` being changed.
2. Make it so clicking the heart icon on any given image runs this method
